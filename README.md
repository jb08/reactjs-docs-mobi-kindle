# Reactjs Docs Mobi Kindle format
Kindle format React Js Docs (July 2020)

Built these docs using [this tool](https://gist.github.com/sebastianrothbucher/e2b82202432657052d6d56bd30bfe6d2). 

I'm not sure why the React community doesn't provide official docs in Kindle format like the Ruby on Rails and Redux communities. Hopefully these will help some people. 

At some point I may add the React blog in Kindle format, that would be nice.
